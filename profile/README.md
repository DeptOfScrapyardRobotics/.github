## About ScrapyardIO

ScrapyardIO is a PHP framework designed to interface with various IO protocols on the Linux platform. We believe that 
building a robotics platform should not be limited to being forced to learn Python, C or Rust at the gate. Adding PHP
into the ecosystem to utilize embedded Linux platforms narrows the gap and creates a new jumping on point, to discover
the rewarding joy and satisfaction of programming more than just websites and CLI commands, but also being able to drive
real life electronic components to make your project come to life!

ScrapyardIO is accessible, very powerful and allows you to extend your capabilities in ways you never thought possible!
